# Basic Concepts

Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented, general purpose programming language. 
It is ranked among the top 10 programming languages worldwide. Much of its growth is attributed to the popularity of software written in Ruby, particularly the Ruby on Rails framework.

A quote from its creator, Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto: "Ruby us simple in appereance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body". 

Matsumoto has said that Ruby is designed for programmer productivity and fun, following the principles of good user interface design. 

In Ruby, everything (even a simple number) is an object. Ruby us also completely free. Not only free of charge, but also free to use, copy, modify and distribute.
